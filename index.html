               </p>
                <p>
                    I first started getting into discord bots in 2019 when I made my first bot called Minesweeper. 
After discord released spoilers I saw somebody send a text based minesweeper game using spoilers in some discord guild. This was pretty cool to me and I decided to automate it to make my own custom minsweeper games. This gave rise to my first ever discord bot which I respectfully named Minesweeper bot. This bot didn’t do much other than generate a text based minesweeper game after you ran a command in a discord chat. The purpose of this was solely this, but of-course I added a few other trivial commands as well. After I finished making the bot I tried to figure out how to host it, I couldn’t figure it out so I ended up giving up. A few months passed and now I was in university, during this time I made my own little discord server where I’d be able to communicate with my peers with ease. I felt as if it would have been cool to have my own bot to moderate the server. So that gave rise to my second ever discord bot, Arty bot.
                </p>
                <p>Arty bot was a personal project, I never meant for it to do much. Most of my code was (and is) very sloppy, none of my variable names made dense, duplicate code everywhere but it didn’t matter, because since I had so much trouble hosting my older bot I figured I’d never get around to hosting my new one. This meant I didn’t plan on making the bot public for anyone to invite and use. Since I was going to run it off my laptop most of my cooler commands were literally just reading from a text file which I manually updated from time to time. Such as the /anime [day] command, I’d literally put in what came out every week in a text file and had my bot read it. Yeah.. I’m not sure what I was doing. But over time I started adding more and more utility commands and after I made art for it I decided to take a break. Took a few months off and focused on my first year at university, and forgot all about the bot. By the time first year ended, and the world was hit by the pandemic I was left with a lot of free time.</p>
                <p>I saw a ton of my upper years make their own bots that were actually pretty cool, and this inspired me to develop my own bot further. This is when I got into using APIs and web scraping because now I planned on actually figuring out how to host my bot for the public to use. By the time I’m writing this, I still haven’t figured it out but I believe I’m almost there. Regardless as days passed more commands were added, atleast 3-5 every day. At one point I felt as if my bot had lost a purpose, it wasn’t meant for anything because it did just so many different things, but at that point I had already put in too much work into it and decided to make it into a utility bot. And so as days went on I added more things, made new art, learned how to make static websites for things like this and here we are. Still fixing errors, still adding new commands, and still trying to figure out how to get this up and running. I know if it gets too big I’ll encounter some issues with api’s and I know that my bot can be really janky at some times but it is what it is and I’m a bit proud of it. My code is still very janky so I don’t plan on making it a open project, but maybe in the future when I make dedicated bots I may. Thanks for reading</p>
